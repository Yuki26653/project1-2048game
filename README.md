## 2048 Game in Python

A simple Python implementation of the classic 2048 game.
This project focuses on practicing grid-based logic, state updates,
and writing readable Python code.

### Features
- 4×4 grid-based board
- Slide and merge logic following standard 2048 rules
- Console-based interaction (w / a / s / d)

### What I focused on
- Implementing the core slide and merge logic
- Handling edge cases when tiles merge
- Keeping the game state updates simple and readable

### Testing
Core game logic is covered with basic pytest unit tests
(slide, merge, and move functions).

### Possible next steps
- Try a simple AI strategy for the game
- Add a basic GUI
- Refactor the code as I learn more
- 
### How to run
python game_2048.py
