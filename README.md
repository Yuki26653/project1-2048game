## 2048 Game in Python

A Python implementation of the classic 2048 game, focusing on
clear game logic, state transitions, and maintainable code structure.

This project was built as a hands-on exercise to strengthen
algorithmic thinking and practical Python programming skills.

---

## Features
- 4×4 grid-based board representation
- Deterministic move and merge logic
- Score tracking
- Clear separation between game state and operations

---

## Engineering Focus
- Designing state-based game logic
- Implementing grid transformations for moves (up, down, left, right)
- Handling edge cases in tile merging
- Writing readable and modular Python code

---

## What I Learned
- Translating game rules into robust algorithms
- Managing state transitions cleanly
- Debugging edge cases in grid-based systems
- Improving code clarity through iteration

---

## Project Status
Core game logic is complete.
The project currently runs in a console-based environment.

---

## Possible Extensions
- Simple AI agent (heuristic-based decision making)
- GUI or web-based interface
- Performance and structure refactoring
